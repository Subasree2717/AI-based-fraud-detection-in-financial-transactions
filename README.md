# AI-based-fraud-detection-in-financial-transactions

As the financial sector increasingly embraces digital transformation, the incidence of fraud has risen, prompting the need for more sophisticated detection methods. This paper presents an AI-based fraud detection system designed to analyze financial transactions in real time, leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify suspicious patterns and anomalies. Our approach utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising historical transaction records, enriched with various features such as transaction amount, time, location, and user behavior. By implementing algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, we achieve high accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives. The system's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional rule-based methods. We also discuss the implications of integrating AI solutions within existing financial infrastructures, highlighting challenges and considerations for deployment. This research aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance security in financial transactions and offers a scalable framework applicable to various financial institutions
